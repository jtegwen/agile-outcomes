Product and Planning 

Goal: Building a product based on consumer needs and perspectives

Why this matters
We build the right thing and have better adoption when we understand the broader picture of our consumers' space.

Long term goals for our product are
	primarily shared verbally
	documented but not understood by all
	documented and understood by all



Short term goals for our product are
	sometimes based on long term goals
	partially based on long term goals
	always anchored in long term goals



The timeline for our short term goals is
	longer than 6 months out
	no more than 6 months out
	no more than 3 months out



Measures of success for goals
	are typically qualitative
	are usually quantifiable
	are all quantifiable



Goals are
	set with client perspectives in mind
	usually set in collaboration with clients
	consistently set in collaboration with clients


The consumer value of the goals is measured
	sometimes
	often
	always


When setting our goals we think about business value as
	something we know very well and has limited to no ambiguity
	something we understand a little and need to discover more to understand well
	something that needs to be continually discovered



Work is anchored in goals
	sometimes
	often
	always



We review and update short term goals for validity and priority in collaboration with funders, stakeholders and clients 
	sometimes; often someone is excluded
	often; usually each group is represented
	consistently; every group is there every time



Progress made towards the goals
	is checked after the end of the goal timeline
	is sometimes checked and communicated to clients
	is routinely checked and communicated to clients
